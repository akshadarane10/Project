# Project Title
Retail Analytics for a Specialty Retail Store

# Agenda
- Exploratory data analysis
- Converting a “Transaction dataset” to “Customer dataset” using - Recency (R), Frequency (F) and Monetary Value (M) 
- Building Segments by RFM – Cluster Analysis: “Statistical    Segmentation”
- Building Segments by RFM Scoring method
- Building Segments using domain rules: “Managerial Segmentation”

# A Customer Segmentation was done on R, F, M
- **Recency** - How much time has elapsed since a customer’s last activity or transaction?
- **Frequency**  - How often has a customer transacted or interacted during a particular period of time?
- **Monetary value** -  Reflects how much a customer has spent, on average, during a particular period of time  

**Recency is a score between 1 and 3, 3 being the most recent** and 1 being the least recent. Recency is significant because it defines customer’s interaction

**Frequency is a score between 1 and 3, 3 being the highest frequency** of orders and 1 being just 1 visit. It’s the number of visit the customer made

**Monetary is also a score between 1 and 3, 3 being the most amount** spend and 1 being the lowest spending. 

# Our Analysis is as followed:
